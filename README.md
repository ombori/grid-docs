# Phygrid Documentation
Welcome to Phygrid Documentation, all you need to know about working with Phygrid and related tooling can be found here. 

?> If there are any unclarities in the documentation or if you want to know more about a specific subject, please ask in our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pgo5586/shared_invite/zt-s1ajca83-k8i1f2mqgCMD0vDfpCk4Bg).

## Phygrid
Phygrid allows any developer to integrate hardware, manage deployments and build amazing infrastructure in physical spaces. You can build a screen that responds to sensors, control hardware based on user interaction, respond to users' requests, and much much more. 

So how do you get started? Take a look at our [getting started guide](/getting-started) to understand how it works, and proceed from there.

> Got a great use case for us to demo right here? Submit it to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pgo5586/shared_invite/zt-s1ajca83-k8i1f2mqgCMD0vDfpCk4Bg)!

## Get involved
Get involved with the documentation. Phygrid Documentation is open source and found on Github (click Github icon top right on any page). Get involved if you spot anything missing to submit a PR or a ticket, or let us know on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pgo5586/shared_invite/zt-s1ajca83-k8i1f2mqgCMD0vDfpCk4Bg) something is wrong or missing! 

We're always on the lookout for better ways to communicate and demonstrate the awesome features of Phygrid, so if you have any ideas let us know!
