# Grid Alerts

Grid Alerts is a platform feature which monitors devices health and sends notifications to specified recipients when a rule's condition is met. You can access the Alerts feature in your tenant page, and navigate to `Menu > Alerts`.

**There are three (3) main functions of Grid Alerts**
- monitors devices health
- monitors analytics behaviour
- sends notifications to defined recipients

In order to monitor a device, it needs to have the `isMonitored` option enabled in the device's Settings page.

## Notification Groups

Before creating an alert rule, we must identify which user emails or endpoints should receive a notification, and group them according to the desired way.

See the [Notification Groups](/core-services/grid-alerts/notification-groups/) section for the details.

## Alert Rules

After defining the recipients, we can then create new or update existing Alert Rules.

See the [Alert Rules](/core-services/grid-alerts/alert-rules/) section for the details.
