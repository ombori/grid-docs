This package is used for React screen app applications. Under the hood, it has special logic to handle video rendering on varying tizen TV versions, webkit-based browsers (i.e. wpe), chrome, raspberry pi, and more.

Example:

```js
import Playlist, { mapItems } from '@ombori/ga-playlist-component';

...
  <Playlist items={playlistItems} />
...
```
